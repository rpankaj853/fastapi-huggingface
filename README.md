# Proposal: FastAPI-HuggingFace Integration for AI-Powered APIs

## Overview

This project, **FastAPI-HuggingFace**, is a backend solution designed to integrate the power of Hugging Face's state-of-the-art machine learning models with the high-performance capabilities of FastAPI. The goal is to provide a scalable, modular, and efficient platform for building AI-powered APIs that cater to various use cases such as text generation, summarization, and question answering.

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides tools to integrate LLMs with external data sources, enabling advanced functionalities such as document retrieval, conversational agents, and more. LangChain supports modularity and extensibility, making it easier to build and manage complex AI workflows.

## What is Hugging Face?

Hugging Face is a leading platform in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It offers a vast repository of pre-trained models for tasks like text generation, summarization, translation, and more. Hugging Face also provides tools like the Transformers library, which simplifies the use of these models in various programming environments.

## Objectives

1. **Seamless Integration**: Combine the strengths of FastAPI and Hugging Face to create a robust backend for AI applications.
2. **Scalability**: Ensure the platform is scalable to handle large datasets and high traffic.
3. **Modularity**: Design the system to allow easy customization and integration of additional models or features.
4. **Ease of Use**: Provide a user-friendly interface for developers to interact with the APIs.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generate creative and contextually relevant text using pre-trained Hugging Face models.
- **Text Summarization**: Summarize long passages into concise and meaningful summaries.
- **Question Answering**: Provide accurate answers to questions based on a given context.
- **Custom Model Integration**: Easily integrate custom Hugging Face models for specific use cases.
- **Authentication**: Secure the APIs with service tokens for controlled access, including additional checks for `SERVICE_TOKEN` in the environment file and code.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rpankaj853/fastapi-huggingface.git
   cd fastapi-huggingface
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Fetch Hugging Face Token**:

   - Visit [Hugging Face Settings](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).
   - Log in or create an account if you don’t have one.
   - Scroll to the "Access Tokens" section and click "New Token".
   - Provide a name for the token, select the required permissions, and generate it.
   - Copy the generated token for the next step.

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

   - Export the Hugging Face token as an environment variable:
     ```bash
     export HF_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
     ```
   - Define a custom service token for additional authentication:
     ```bash
     export CUSTOM_SERVICE_TOKEN=your_custom_service_token
     ```
   - Ensure the `service_token` is validated in the code for secure API access.

6. **Run the Server**:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

7. **Access the API Documentation**:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/pr/docs` for Swagger UI.
   - Alternatively, access the Redoc documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/pr/redoc`.
